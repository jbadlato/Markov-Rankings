- Put old project into folder "v1"
- Create new folder "v2" for new design
- Data Retrieval: 
	- Pull from masseyratings.com, include scheduled games
	- Insert into _TEAMS tables only at beginning of season
	- Update database tables daily--will have to use update statements rather than inserts
		- Update by matching to { SEASON_ID, GAME_DATE, TEAM_ID, OPPONENT_ID }.  This will break if any two teams have a double-header against each other--which shouldn't happen in the leagues currently used, the algorithm isn't great for series-formatted leagues like the MLB anyway
	- Update twitter handles 
	- Store scores in database tables: 
		- separate tables for each league
		- LEAGUE

	- Update to new season automatically if possible
		- Read/store links to masseyratings in SEASON table
- Data Processing: 
	- Run algorithm as before--clean up javascript methods
		- Find (& prove) a more robust end condition--can the algorithm run for less time?
		- Figure out why algorithm crashes when running early in the season & fix the issue
			- Determine minimum amount of information needed for rankings to be meaningful--most likely when the graph is connected. Definitely shouldn't be calculated before then.
		- Run weekly to store in rankings tables, but run daily to show to users temporarily--can overwrite in database.
	- Update Win/Loss records in TEAM table
	- Predict scores of future games
		- Find (& prove) an efficient method for doing this based on model
	- Store rankings in database table: 
		- RANK table
	- Only calculate rankings when necessary
	- Store predictions in database table:
		- in PREDICTION column in PREDICTION table
		- May need to run this strategically throughout the week, depending on how costly the calculation is
- Data Display: 
	- Allow user to view rankings by week - also a tab for daily/live rankings (not saved in database)
		- Pull from rankings table
		- Show movement in rankings using green/red arrows
	- Add tabs for AP Poll, Coaches Poll, etc. if applicable
	- Show logos of team--pull data file name from database
	- Show team's schedule & ranking history when team name is clicked
	- Allow user to compare two teams side by side
	- Use React for new UI
	- Generate line graph of a team's ranking over time--R scripts
		- Allow user to select which teams they want to see the line graph of--on compare team screen?
- Data Sharing:
	- Tweet rankings weekly--clean up javascript methods
		- Get twitter names from TEAM table
		- Generate infographic using team logos 
	- Social Media share links
	- "Biggest Movers" -- share links for jumps in rankings
		- Tweet ranking shifts greater than some threshold? Or biggest mover every week?
	- Tweet score predictions to important games each week
		- use twitter API to predict which games are popular--what teams are people talking about?
	- Tweet biggest upset of the week
	- Create API to query the scores data saved in the database tables for public use?
- Miscellaneous/Documentation:
	- Data Analysis of how well the model predicts future outcomes
		- Compare to AP Poll, Coaches Poll, etc. if applicable
	- Unit tests to run before every deployment
	- Add logging to a log file
	- Add more error handling
	- Rewrite explanation/tutorial of ranking methods?
